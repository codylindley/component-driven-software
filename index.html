        Component Driven Software is a catch-all term used to describe the methodologies and tools for subdividing part
        or all of an application into independently specified and managed presentational (i.e., UI components) and
        nonpresentational composable components. Components are built, versioned, and tested separately from application
        development concerns and in lockstep with Visual Design, Interaction Design, and User Experience design
        requirements to ensure UI quality and avoid difficult to maintain monolithic software applications.

        <h2>1 : Why Component-driven Software?</h2>

        <p>The following points broadly explain why an organization might consider adopting the tenants of Component
          Driven Software:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Applications built from component tree architectures (e.g., Vue, React, Angular, etc) can result in
            thousands of unversioned built-as-needed undocumented and disorganized components resulting in monolithic
            front-end applications that are slow to build, have subpar UI's, have tightly coupled components, and are
            often difficult to maintain and scale. Ideally, what is needed is a system in which most if not all the
            components, especially UI components, become first-class design citizens that are constructed in
            isolation, self-contained, versioned, and given the proper documentation and isolated testing routines.
          </li>
          <li>
            Front-end applications as of late are being development by developers who are responsible for architecting
            the application, handling data retrieval, handling global state
            concerns, as well as constructing and testing all components within the applicaiton (including UI
            components). Front-end application developers
            carry too much
            workload when building user-centered, maintainable, cross-device, cross-platform, front-end
            applicationsâ€”this workload
            results in long, complicated development cycles. For complex front-end applications, application developers
            have too
            many responsibilities. As a result, the UI can become a second-class citizen or afterthought to application
            developers.
            Ideally, the burden of application development needs to be distributed to UI developers who are focused on
            building,
            testing, and maintaining UI components in a walled-off garden while application developers can
            simultaneously be working
            on application concerns.
          </li>
          <li>
            Organizations all too often fail to set up the proper systems and owners around design practices and
            development practices that facilitate sophisticated abstractions and correctly scoped reusable materials.
            Ideally, organizations should erect "Design System(s)" that fuel a "Component Driven System" that fuels
            application development. These solutions require appropriately skilled owners that play a particular role
            within an organization's design and engineering practices.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2 : How is Component Driven Software Done?</h2>

        <p>Component-driven software is built from a component-driven system. A component-driven system is a system
          instituted by an organization made up of the <strong>goals</strong>, <strong>processes</strong>,
          <strong>strategies/architectures</strong>, <strong>people/roles</strong>, and <strong>tools</strong> used by
          the organization to birth and nurture independently built components.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Goals:</strong>
          Speed development? Fortify the quality and of the user interface and the user experience? Visual unification?
          Separate application development from UI development? Avoid monolithic unmaintainable applications that have
          to be re-built too often? Reuse?
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Processes:</strong>
          How will components be defined? When will components be defined? When are they built? How will updates to
          components be managed? How does this fit into
          your development process that exists today? Do component collections accept contributions?
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Strategies/Architectures:</strong>
          Do you need top down components, bottom up, or both?
          Will you build presentational components and nonpresentational components? Will you build primitive UI
          components as well as domain UI components. How will you organize your component sets? By product/application?
          By device? By platform? By all three?
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>People/Roles:</strong>
          Who is responsible for defining components (designer, developers, both?). Who is responsible for building and
          documenting
          components (UI developers, application developers, both?). Who is responsible for maintaining the component
          specifications and component implementations? Will you construct a focused team around components?
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Tools:</strong>
          Which tools will you employ, and how will they be utilized to support the system?
        </p>

        <p>There is no one way to go about building component-driven software or constructing a component-driven system.
          No two organizations will likely ever erect the same component-driven system to build component-driven
          software. However, there are some foundational tenets of building component-driven software using a
          component-driven system.</p>

        <p>Common tenets of a component-driven software are:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Components get developed in isolation, tested in isolation, and are independently versioned using semver.
          </li>
          <li>Components become individual packages and get distributed using a public or private module repository
            (e.g., npm) for installing and uninstalling versioned module packages.</li>
          <li>Component-driven systems are engineered so that components within the system can be consumed to create
            other richer components within the system (i.e., Domain UI components are composed of Primitive UI
            components or said another way, Primitive UI components can be gathered together in order to produce Domain
            UI components).</li>
          <li>Component-driven development is a separate concern from the concerns of application architecture and
            application development.</li>
          <li>Components will undergo component specific unit testing (e.g., Jest), visually testing (e.g., Percy), and
            functional testing (e.g.,
            Cypress) before they are consumed into an application runtime. Applications then test the implementation of
            a component, not the component themselves.</li>
          <li>UI components are extracted from feature specifications by designers (worse case developers) and specified
            separately from feature specifications.</li>
          <li>Components are viewed as a game of composition. When components, especially UI components are view in
            this way application developers can build the bulk of an application from custom pre-built, heavily
            documented, and pre-test UI components that have fallen out of traditional UI mockups/screens. </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Disregarding one of the tenets mentioned above will erode the value of component-driven systems relatively
          quickly.</p>

        <h2>Terms</h2>

        <h3>Application Runtime</h3>

        <p>Where application developers install and implement components to produce a working application.</p>

        <h3>Bottom-Up Components</h3>

        <p>A collection of custom-built components the when implemented, are intended to construct a known and already
          specified set of feature specifications within a product/application. Implementing and adopting these
          components is trivial because components are constructed specifically for a product or application from the
          design team (typically using a design system). Think of bottom-up components as the result of breaking down a
          product or application into primitive and domain components that have been precisely designed for the product
          or application.</p>

        <h3>Component-driven software</h3>

        <p>Catch-all term used to describe the methodologies and tools for subdividing part or all of an application
          into independently specified and managed presentational (i.e., UI components) and nonpresentational composable
          components. The components are built, versioned, and tested separately from application development concerns
          and design concerns to ensure quality and avoid monolithic software applications.</p>

        <h3>Compoent-driven system </h3>

        <p>A systematic plan instituted by an organization made up of the goals, processes, strategies/architectures,
          people/roles, and tools leveraged by an organization in order to birth and nurture components for
          component-driven software applications.</p>

        <h3>Component Specifications </h3>

        <p>Refers to a specification created by designers explicitly scoped to the details of a component alone.
          Component specifications typically fall out of feature specifications.</p>

        <h3>Design System</h3>

        <p>A set of reusable design-related rules (tokens, patterns, behaviors, language) as a system of instructions
          that can fuel various implementations. Design systems are the fuel used to create component implementations.
        </p>

        <h3>Domain UI/Presentational Components</h3>

        <p>A component, typically constructed for a specific application or product that does not have any obvious UI
          reuse but exists to provide application developers with more
          than just simplistic and generic reusable components (i.e., a unique view or specific "organism/molecule" to
          borrow from Atomic Design). These components are often complex and take up a lot of the user's attention and
          view within a user interface (e.g., an entire header or footer or a complex domain-specific search UI).</p>

        <h3>Feature Specifications</h3>

        <p>Refers to the specifications created by designers to communicate the features of an entire application.
          Feature Specifications typically come in the form of high fidelity or low fidelity page or screen mockups with
          annotations describing the user experience and or interaction designs intended by the designers.</p>

        <h3>Mirco Frontends</h3>

        <p>An application architecture that results in a single application constructed from more than one application
          runtime (be it an iframe or a module that represents an application)</p>

        <h3>Primitive UI/Presentational Components</h3>

        <p>A component built that priorities an innate reusable nature (e.g., buttons, Icons, Modals, etc.) rather than
          a specific domain use case (i.e., similar to "Atoms" from Atomic Design). Primitive components are often
          constructed to be consumed by domain components to create less general UI components.</p>

        <h3>Top Down Components</h3>

        <p>A collection of nonspecific optimistically produced components with generic cross-cutting features typically
          valued on the promise of UI unification and reuse. Think of top-down components as components that are not
          built with any specific product or application in mind but as off-the-shelf generic solutions to common UI
          patterns (e.g., a generic modal component). Few organizations can benefit or maintain a set of top-down
          components while creating custom user-centered UI's. No one component can account for all current and future
          use cases within custom UI's. Top-down component systems often fail because they are leveraged in situations
          that most often require bottom-up components. Top-down components do have a use case, but they are usually for
          prototyping, non-critical UI's, generically patterned UI's, or as plumbing to bottom-up components in the form
          of headless or unstyled UI parts (e.g., reakit.io, readix-ui.com, headlessui.dev). </p>

      <div id="chapter5" class="chapter">

        <h2>FAQ</h2>

        <h3>Wait, are you saying build unique collections of components for each product or applicatioin?</h3>

        <p>Yes. This exactly the notion at the heart of component driven development (i.e. bottom up components). By way
          of a components driven
          system any organization should be able to create a collection of components specific to the needs of each
          product or application in a trivial amount of team guaranteeing the quality and integrity of the components
          well into the future.
        </p>

        <h3>Isn't this just window dressing around the idea of leveraging UI Toolkits?</h3>

        <p>
          If your organization has the luxury (few do) of building software from a slightly customizable off-the-shelf
          UI toolkit,
          then you have already surrendered the UI to a generalized set of top-down components that come with
          pre-determined
          features, behaviors, and interactions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Suppose a product owner determines they will build an application with something like Material-UI components;
          they have
          in many ways already determined the features of the components that can be used to solve UI problems. They
          have forced
          the hands of the designers as well as the application developers because by adopting pre-built components,
          they have
          restricted the UI to a broad set of solutions. Pre-built UI components have baked into them generalized
          solutions to
          common UI patterns. Using pre-built components as-is affects how UI's can be built to solve user interface
          problems in a
          user-centered-minded manner.
        </p>

        <p>
          Does this mean that all components in a component-driven system are custom built from the ground up. No!
          However, it
          does mean that if you are borrowing something from a third-party, then you should wrap it up in a custom
          component so
          that the details of the implementation are abstracted.
        </p>

        <p>
          Component-driven software and the system devised to support the tenets of component-driven software are
          typically
          instituted within an organization when the organization recognizes that bottom-up components are needed to
          construct
          custom user-centered UI's for individual applications that may run across various platforms and devices using
          one or more design systems.
        </p>

        <h3>Where/when does a "Design System" come into play?</h3>

        <p>I define a design system as "a set of reusable design-related rules (tokens, patterns, behaviors, language)
          as a system of instructions that can fuel various types of implementations that can or cannot be component
          driven." </p>

        <p>Design Systems are used by designers and interaction designers and come before implementations. UI components
          and theme
          components consume a Design System.</p>

        <p>Don't conflate a design system with an implementation fueld by a Design system. Design systems end where
          implementations and component driven systems begin.</p>

        <h3>Is this just another name for a "Micro Frontend"?</h3>

        <p>I define a "Micro Frontend" to mean, "An application architecture that results in a single application
          constructed from more than one application runtime (be it an iframe or a module that represents an application
          running in the same frame)."</p>

        <p>The terms "component-driven" and "Micro Frontends" are often conflated. Don't confuse these two terms because
          subdividing software into components and subdividing software (including the UI) into separate runtimes/apps
          might share the nature of subdividing a thing but the concepts have very different purposes, costs, and
          returns. A micro frontend architecture can use components from a component-driven system just like any
          non-micro frontend architecture.</p>

        <h3>Is this just Atomic Design applied to applications made from component trees?</h3>

        <p>Atomic design is a sematic useful for drawing boundaries around UI's when creating style guides. This concept
          is somewhat of a deprecated practice given the advancements of Design Systems. In a modern sense the value of
          the semantics provided by Atomic Design devolves quickly because overly categorizing components induces mental
          model complexities and confusion when building composable components.</p>

        <p>For this reason, when thinking in terms of UI components, I have found it easier to think in terms of
          primitive UI components v.s. domain UI components. To briefly borrow and simplify Atomic Design semantics the
          only line of demarcating needed is a component is either an "Atom" or something more than an Atom. Said
          another way a component is built with the nature of composition as a first-order priority (i.e, primitive like
          a button) or not (i.e. domain like a specific header in an app that may or may not contain primitive
          components).</p>

        <p>In many ways, a proper Design System has replaced the need to think in terms of Atomic Design. A Design
          System properly fueling a component-driven system (via component specifications) should be all that is needed
          today. But make no mistake about it, Atomic Designed paved the way for Design Systems and Component Driven
          Software.</p>
