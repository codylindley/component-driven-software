        Component Driven Software is a catch-all term used to describe the methodologies and tools for subdividing part
        or all of an application into <a
          href="https://blog.bitsrc.io/independent-components-the-webs-new-building-blocks-59c893ef0f65">independently</a>
        specified and managed presentational (i.e., UI components) and
        nonpresentational components. Components are built, versioned, and tested separately from application
        development concerns and in lockstep with Visual Design, Interaction Design, and User Experience design
        requirements to ensure UI quality and avoid difficult to maintain monolithic software applications.

        <h2>1 : Why Component-driven Software?</h2>

        <p>The following points broadly explain why an organization might consider adopting the tenants of Component
          Driven Software:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Applications built from component tree architectures (e.g., Vue, React, Angular, etc) can result in
            thousands of unversioned built-as-needed undocumented and disorganized components resulting in monolithic
            front-end applications that are slow to build, have subpar UI's, have tightly coupled components, and are
            often difficult to maintain and scale. Ideally, what is needed is a system in which most if not all the
            components, especially UI components, become first-class citizens that are constructed in
            isolation, self-contained, versioned, and given the proper documentation and isolated testing routines.
          </li>
          <li>
            Front-end applications as of late are being development by developers who are responsible for architecting
            the application, handling data retrieval, handling global state
            concerns, as well as constructing and testing all components within the applicaiton (including UI
            components). Front-end application developers
            carry too much
            workload when building user-centered, maintainable, cross-device, cross-platform, front-end
            applicationsâ€”this workload
            results in long, complicated development cycles. For complex applications, application developers
            have too
            many responsibilities. As a result, component management (especially UI components) can become a
            second-class citizen or afterthought to application
            developers.
            Ideally, the burden of application development needs to be distributed to UI developers who are focused on
            building,
            testing, and maintaining UI components in a walled-off garden while application developers can
            simultaneously be working
            on application concerns.
          </li>
          <li>
            Organizations all too often fail to set up the proper systems and owners around design practices and
            development practices that facilitate sophisticated abstractions and correctly scoped reusable materials.
            Ideally, organizations should erect "Design System(s)" that fuel a "Component Driven System" that fuels
            application development. These solutions require appropriately skilled owners that play a particular role
            within an organization's design and engineering practices.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2 : Component-drive Software Tenants</h2>

        <p>There is no one way to go about doing component-driven software or constructing a component-driven system.
          No two organizations are exactly alike, with the same problems to solve, and no two organizations will erect
          the same component-driven
          system. This makes prescribing any single canonical component-driven system difficult. However, there are
          some foundational tenets of building component-driven software which component-driven systems will
          likely commonly embody.</p>

        <p>Common tenets of a component-driven system are:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Components get developed in isolation, tested in isolation, and are <a
              href="https://blog.bitsrc.io/independent-components-the-webs-new-building-blocks-59c893ef0f65">independently</a>
            versioned using semver.
          </li>
          <li>Components become individual packages and get distributed using a public or private module repository
            (e.g., npm) for installing and uninstalling versioned module packages.</li>
          <li>Component-driven systems are engineered so that components within the system can be consumed to create
            other richer components within the system (i.e., Domain UI components are composed of Primitive UI
            components or said another way, Primitive UI components can be gathered together in order to produce Domain
            UI components).</li>
          <li>Components are a separate concern from the concerns of application architecture and
            application development.</li>
          <li>Components will undergo isolated unit testing (e.g., Jest), visually testing (e.g., Percy), and
            functional testing (e.g.,
            Cypress) before they are consumed into an application runtime. Applications then test the implementation of
            a component, not the component itself.</li>
          <li>UI components are extracted from feature specifications by designers (worse case developers) and specified
            separately from feature specifications.</li>
          <li>Components are viewed as a game of composition. When components, especially bottom-up UI components are
            view in
            this way application developers can build the bulk of an application from custom pre-built, heavily
            documented, and pre-test UI components that have fallen out of traditional UI mockups/screens and business
            requirements. </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Disregarding one of the tenets mentioned above will erode the value of component-driven systems relatively
          quickly.</p>

      </div>

      <div id="chapter3" class="chapter">

        <h2>3 : How is Component-driven Software Done?</h2>

        <p>Component-driven software is built from a component-driven system. A component-driven system is a system
          instituted by an organization that defines/facilitates the <strong>goals</strong>,
          <strong>roles-processes-assets</strong>,
          <strong>strategies-architectures</strong>, and <strong>tools</strong> used by
          the organization to birth and nurture <a
            href="https://blog.bitsrc.io/independent-components-the-webs-new-building-blocks-59c893ef0f65">independently</a>
          built components.
        </p>

        <h3>3.1 : Goals</h3>

        <p>
          Before adopting component driven software practices an organization should get all the stakeholders in
          alignment
          on the
          goals of adopting such a methodology. Don't over complicate the matter. Start by prioritizing a list of goals
          and
          then make
          decisions based off the list.
        </p>

        <p><strong>What are you goals:</strong>
          Speed development? Fortify the quality of the user interface and the user experience? Reuse? Visual
          unification? Behavioral Unification? Experiential Unification?
          Separate application development from UI development? Avoid monolithic unmaintainable applications that have
          to be re-built too often?
        </p>

        <h3>3.2 : Strategies & Architectures</h3>

        <p>After an organization has a set of goals it will then need to use these goals to decide upon a component
          strategy and
          architecture.</p>

        <p><strong>Answer the following questions:</strong>
          Do you need top down-components, bottom-up, or both?
          Will you build UI components and nonpresentational components? Will you build primitive UI
          components as well as domain UI components. How will you organize your component sets? By product/application?
          By device? By platform? By all three? How does the Design System integrate? Will the component sets need to be
          themeable?
        </p>

        <h3>3.3 : Roles, Processes, Assets</h3>

        <p>With a set of goals and a component strategy & architecture defined the design and engineering organization
          will have
          to determine a design and development process for building independent components.</p>

        <p>
          <strong>Determine:</strong> How will components be defined? When will components be defined? How will updates
          to
          components be managed? How does this fit into
          your development process that exists today? Do component collections accept contributions? Who is responsible
          for defining components (designer, developers, both?). Who is responsible for building and
          documenting
          components (UI developers, application developers, both?). Who is responsible for maintaining the component
          specifications and component implementations? Will you build a focused team around components? Will the team
          have transient contributors or focused permanent full-time roles?
        </p>

        <h3>3.4 : Tools</h3>

        <p>The last part of a component-driven system will typically involve picking the tools necessary for building
          component driven software. The main
          tools for building component driven software can be divided into two main catagories, "Design Tools"
          and "Development Tools".</p>

        <p><strong>Design Tools:</strong></p>

        <p>Various design tools are available for specifying components and development/managing design systems. However
          Figma
          in
          my opinion rises to the top.
          Here is why:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Figma files can be embedded into component driven systems (e.g. using the <a
              href="https://storybook.js.org/addons/storybook-addon-designs/">Storybook Designs addon</a> you can add
            Figma for display directly when storybook when viewing a component)
          </li>
          <li>Figma has inline commenting/feedback system.</li>
          <li>Figma allows more than one editor at a time which facilitates realtime collaborations</li>
          <li>Figma offers a rich set of features and plugins for authors of Design Systems.</li>
          <li>Figma is web based.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Development Tools:</strong></p>

        <p>Two distinct options are available today for developers to develop <a
            href="https://blog.bitsrc.io/independent-components-the-webs-new-building-blocks-59c893ef0f65">independent
            components</a>.</p>

        <p>The first option entails using a tailored set of open source tools that as a whole will provide the means to
          create and distribute independent components using a <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo">monorepo.</a>
        </p>

        <p>An example set of these tools would be:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">NPM Registry</a>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40locus-labs">NPM Organization</a></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/">Yarn</a>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/yarn-workflow">Yarn Workspaces</a></li>
              <li><a href="https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/run">Yarn Run</a></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/lerna/lerna#readme">Lerna</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://storybook.js.org/">Storybook</a></li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/">Rollup</a>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/#babel">Babel</a></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>The second option would be to use Bit (specifically <a href="https://harmony-docs.bit.dev/">Bit Harmony</a>).
          Bit is currently the only product offering
          in
          this space that does
          most of what option one does but offers it as a product/solution with enterprise features. I like to
          think of Bit as a node app
          that can replace the majority of the tools from option one but with the added bonus of <a
            href="https://bit.dev/">Bit.dev</a>. Bit.dev is
          where Bit
          components can be publicly or privately hosted, shared, and composed with anyone.</p>

        <p>I think it important to call out a couple of items Bit does really well v.s. curating a system from
          open source parts.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Bit will version not just every release of the component itself (i.e. an npm sermver) but also the
            collateral that
            supports the component (e.g. demos, docs, etc...). In a sense, Bit Harmony is Git for independent
            components. Bit manages development history and it allows you to go back in time and review the
            documentation, compositions (i.e. stories), tests, and dependencies from previous versions of the
            components.
          </li>
          <li>Bit conceals the complexities of Yarn workspaces, Lerna, Babel, npm, and build tools.</li>
          <li>Bit offers Bit.dev, a place to immediately host and share your components with ease.</li>
          <li>Bit works with presentational components as well as non-presentational components. In other words it does
            not assume you only want to build UI components.</li>
        </ol>

      </div>


      <div id="chapter4" class="chapter">

        <h2>4 : LocusLabs Use Case</h2>

        <h3>4.1 : Overview</h3>

        <p>In March 2020 I was hired by the CTO and VP of Product from LocusLabs to orchestrate a component driven
          software practice. What is describe here is the component driven system I built for locuslabs.</p>

        <p>As you read this use case keep in mind that the decisions for the system were unique to LocusLabs. Note that
          LocusLabs built several different types of applications running
          on various devices (Kiosks, Large Displays, Desktops & Laptops, Tablets, and Mobile phones) used or viewed by
          various
          types of users (i.e. stationary users viewing only, walking users viewing only, kiosk touch users,
          desktop/laptop mouse users, mobile phone touch users). The system built for Locuslabs is not a general
          prescription for other organization. Use the use case as an example of the practice of creating systems. Each
          organization will erect a different system.</p>

        <h3>4.2 : Goals</h3>

        <p>Both design and engineering
          agreed on the following component-driven goals:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Produce as much of the UI as possible for any given product/application in conjunction with design in the
            form of UI components so application developers can focus on application development and not UI development.
          </li>
          <li>Have UI integrity (visual design, behavior design, interaction design) baked into the components before
            they are implemented.</li>
          <li>Speed the development and UI quality of products/applications by creating a new engineering group who
            focused on the
            development and testing of UI components that had been specified in detail by the design team using
            component specifications.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>4.3 : Strategies & Architectures</h3>

        <p>The LocusLabs design and engineering groups determined the following strategy and component architecture to
          meet the
          agreed upon goals:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Build bottom-up independent components (individually versioned and installed) for each
            product/application.</li>
          <li>Each product/application would use its own design system.</li>
          <li>The component collections will be organized by product > device (optional) > composability.</li>
          <li>Component re-use only occurs internally within each product/application. In no way did
            products/applications share components externally. The cost to repeat oneself was trivial compared to the
            risks of any type of top down components tightly coupling products together or complicating component
            development and design.</li>
          <li>Each component set will use a theme
            that can be overridden (i.e. customizable design tokens from the design system).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>An example collection of components for a product called, "Maps Online" would be:</p>


        <ul>
          <li>Maps Online Desktop/Tablet Components:<ul>
              <li>domain<ul>
                  <li>componentA</li>
                  <li>componentB</li>
                  <li>etc</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>primitive<ul>
                  <li>componentA</li>
                  <li>componentB</li>
                  <li>etc</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Maps Online Mobile Components:<ul>
              <li>domain<ul>
                  <li>componentA</li>
                  <li>componentB</li>
                  <li>etc</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>primitive<ul>
                  <li>componentA</li>
                  <li>componentB</li>
                  <li>etc</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>


        <p>Laboring an agreed upon strategy and architecture was not easy feat. It took weeks of conversations and
          focusing on the goals to arrive at an agreed upon idea of what to build.</p>

        <p>Below are a few of the diagrams that were used when discussing the correct components strategy and
          architecture:</p>

        <div class="images">

          <div class="item"><img src="img/option1.png"></div>

          <div class="item"><img src="img/option2.png"></div>

          <div class="item"><img src="img/option3.png"></div>

          <div class="item"><img src="img/option4.png"></div>

          <div class="item"><img src="img/b.png"></div>

          <div class="item"><img src="img/d.png"></div>

        </div>

        <h3>4.4 : Roles, Processes, Assets</h3>

        <p>A new engineering group was formed within the LocusLabs made up of two full-time
          front-end UI
          engineers and one front-end UI engineer lead. The team was called the, "UI Component Dev Team". The lead
          worked with design to build out a component-driven
          process and a component specification template that would produce a collection of bottom-up components for
          each
          product.
        </p>

        <p>The process:</p>

        <div class="image">
          <img src="img/c.png">
        </div>

        <p>The component specification template:</p>

        <div class="image">
          <img src="img/template.png">
        </div>

        <p>The process worked as follows. Each feature of
          a
          product/application would be built out according to the business requirements using standard screen mockups
          which describe how the features of the product/application were to function according to the end user.</p>

        <p>e.g. mockup representing the building level selector feature in the Maps Online product:</p>

        <div class="image">
          <img src="img/e.png">
        </div>

        <p>Then design would break down all the mockups into primitive and domain components specifications (i.e.
          letting the components fall out of the feature specifications).</p>

        <p>e.g. the building level selector domain components specification:</p>

        <div class="image">
          <img src="img/f.png">
        </div>

        <div class="notes">

          <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong>
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Component specifications could also define their own internal primitive components that we called facets.
              These facets were consider components that required individual specifications but were not publicly
              re-usable (i.e. primitive components).
              You'll notice in the building level selector component specification above that the component was also
              composed of four internal components.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <p>e.g. the primitive components that composed the building level selector domain component:</p>

        <div class="images">

          <div class="item"><img src="img/g.png"></div>

          <div class="item"><img src="img/i.png"></div>

          <div class="item"><img src="img/j.png"></div>

        </div>

        <p>Once the component specifications were available the engineers from the UI component dev team would
          take the specifications and build out the components and create the automated visual and functional test for
          each
          component using the tools decided upon by the teams lead UI engineer:</p>

        <p>e.g. here is the built domain Building Level Selector component inside of Storybook:</p>

        <div class="images">

          <div class="item"><img src="img/h.png"></div>

          <div class="item"><img src="img/k.png"></div>

          <div class="item"><img src="img/l.png"></div>

        </div>

        <h2>Terms</h2>

        <h3>Application Runtime</h3>

        <p>When the source code for an application is executed and the application is running (e.g. if you use React
          then the runtime is when the web platform takes your built code and runs it to produce a running application
          in a web browser)</p>

        <h3>Bottom-Up Components</h3>

        <p>A collection of custom-built components the when implemented, are intended to construct a known and already
          specified set of feature specifications within a product/application. Implementing and adopting these
          components is trivial because components are constructed specifically for a product or application from the
          design team (typically using a design system). Think of bottom-up components as the result of breaking down a
          product or application into primitive and domain components that have been precisely designed for the product
          or application.</p>

        <h3>Component-driven software</h3>

        <p>Catch-all term used to describe the methodologies and tools for subdividing part or all of an application
          into <a
            href="https://blog.bitsrc.io/independent-components-the-webs-new-building-blocks-59c893ef0f65">independently</a>
          specified and managed presentational (i.e., UI components) and nonpresentational composable
          components. The components are built, versioned, and tested separately from application development concerns
          and design concerns to ensure quality and avoid monolithic software applications.</p>

        <h3>Component-driven system </h3>

        <p>A systematic plan instituted by an organization made up of the goals, strategies-architectures,
          roles-processes-assets, and tools leveraged by an organization in order to birth and nurture components for
          component-driven software applications.</p>

        <h3>Component Integration</h3>

        <p>The source code were components are installed and implemented into use.</p>

        <h3>Component Specifications </h3>

        <p>Refers to a specification created by designers explicitly scoped to the details of a component alone.
          Component specifications typically fall out of feature specifications.</p>

        <h3>Design System</h3>

        <p>A set of reusable design-related rules (tokens, patterns, behaviors, language) as a system of instructions
          that can fuel various implementations. Design systems are the fuel used to create component implementations.
        </p>

        <h3>Domain UI/Presentational Components</h3>

        <p>A component, typically constructed for a specific application or product that does not have any obvious UI
          reuse but exists to provide application developers with more
          than just simplistic and generic reusable components (i.e., a unique view or specific "organism/molecule" to
          borrow from Atomic Design). These components are often complex and take up a lot of the user's attention and
          view within a user interface (e.g., an entire header or footer or a complex domain-specific search UI).</p>

        <h3>Feature Specifications</h3>

        <p>Refers to the specifications created by designers to communicate the features of an entire application.
          Feature Specifications typically come in the form of high fidelity or low fidelity page or screen mockups with
          annotations describing the user experience and or interaction designs intended by the designers.</p>

        <h3>Mirco Frontends</h3>

        <p>An application architecture that results in a single application constructed from more than one application
          runtime (be it an iframe or a module that represents an application)</p>

        <h3>Primitive UI/Presentational Components</h3>

        <p>A component built that priorities an innate reusable nature (e.g., buttons, Icons, Modals, etc.) rather than
          a specific domain use case (i.e., similar to "Atoms" from Atomic Design). Primitive components are often
          constructed to be consumed by domain components to create less general UI components.</p>

        <h3>Top Down Components</h3>

        <p>A collection of nonspecific optimistically produced components with generic cross-cutting features typically
          valued on the promise of UI unification and reuse. Think of top-down components as components that are not
          built with any specific product or application in mind but as off-the-shelf generic solutions to common UI
          patterns (e.g., a generic modal component). Few organizations can benefit or maintain a set of top-down
          components while creating custom user-centered UI's. No one component can account for all current and future
          use cases within custom UI's. Top-down component systems often fail because they are leveraged in situations
          that most often require bottom-up components. Top-down components do have a use case, but they are usually for
          prototyping, non-critical UI's, generically patterned UI's, or as plumbing to bottom-up components in the form
          of headless or unstyled UI parts (e.g., reakit.io, readix-ui.com, headlessui.dev). </p>

        <h2>FAQ</h2>

        <h3>Wait, are you saying build unique collections of components for each product or application?</h3>

        <p>Yes. This exactly the notion at the heart of component driven development (i.e. bottom up components). By way
          of a components driven
          system any organization should be able to create a collection of components specific to the needs of each
          product or application in a trivial amount of team guaranteeing the quality and integrity of the components
          well into the future.
        </p>

        <h3>Isn't this just window dressing around the idea of leveraging UI Toolkits?</h3>

        <p>
          If your organization has the luxury (few do) of building software from a slightly customizable off-the-shelf
          UI toolkit,
          then you have already surrendered the UI to a generalized set of top-down components that come with
          pre-determined
          features, behaviors, and interactions.

          Suppose a product owner determines they will build an application with something like Material-UI components;
          they have
          in many ways already determined the features of the components that can be used to solve UI problems. They
          have forced
          the hands of the designers as well as the application developers because by adopting pre-built components,
          they have
          restricted the UI to a broad set of solutions. Pre-built UI components have baked into them generalized
          solutions to
          common UI patterns. Using pre-built components as-is affects how UI's can be built to solve user interface
          problems in a
          user-centered-minded manner.
        </p>

        <p>
          Does this mean that all components in a component-driven system are custom built from the ground up. No!
          However, it
          does mean that if you are borrowing something from a third-party, then you should wrap it up in a custom
          component so
          that the details of the implementation are abstracted.
        </p>

        <p>
          Component-driven software and the system devised to support the tenets of component-driven software are
          typically
          instituted within an organization when the organization recognizes that bottom-up components are needed to
          construct
          custom user-centered UI's for individual applications that may run across various platforms and devices using
          one or more design systems.
        </p>

        <h3>Where/when does a "Design System" come into play?</h3>

        <p>I define a design system as "a set of reusable design-related rules (tokens, patterns, behaviors, language)
          as a system of instructions that can fuel various types of implementations that can or cannot be component
          driven." </p>

        <p>Design Systems are used by designers and interaction designers and come before implementations. UI components
          and theme
          components consume a Design System.</p>

        <p>Don't conflate a design system with an implementation fueled by a Design system. Design systems end where
          implementations and component driven systems begin.</p>

        <h3>Is this just another name for a "Micro Frontend"?</h3>

        <p>I define a "Micro Frontend" to mean, "An application architecture that results in a single application
          constructed from more than one application runtime (be it an iframe or a module that represents an application
          running in the same frame)."</p>

        <p>The terms "component-driven" and "Micro Frontends" are often conflated. Don't confuse these two terms because
          subdividing software into components and subdividing software (including the UI) into separate runtimes/apps
          might share the nature of subdividing a thing but the concepts have very different purposes, costs, and
          returns. A micro frontend architecture can use components from a component-driven system just like any
          non-micro frontend architecture.</p>

        <h3>Is this just Atomic Design applied to applications made from component trees?</h3>

        <p>Atomic design is a sematic useful for drawing boundaries around UI's when creating style guides. This concept
          is somewhat of a deprecated practice given the advancements of Design Systems. In a modern sense the value of
          the semantics provided by Atomic Design devolves quickly because overly categorizing components induces mental
          model complexities and confusion when building composable components.</p>

        <p>For this reason, when thinking in terms of UI components, I have found it easier to think in terms of
          primitive UI components v.s. domain UI components. To briefly borrow and simplify Atomic Design semantics the
          only line of demarcating needed is a component is either an "Atom" or something more than an Atom. Said
          another way a component is built with the nature of composition as a first-order priority (i.e, primitive like
          a button) or not (i.e. domain like a specific header in an app that may or may not contain primitive
          components).</p>

        <p>In many ways, a proper Design System has replaced the need to think in terms of Atomic Design. A Design
          System properly fueling a component-driven system (via component specifications) should be all that is needed
          today. But make no mistake about it, Atomic Designed paved the way for Design Systems and Component Driven
          Software.</p>
